# The-Island-of-Truth-and-Lies-Puzzle
Problem Statement:
You arrive at an island where two types of inhabitants live: truth-tellers, who always tell the truth, and liars, who always lie. You encounter two inhabitants named Alex and Bob. You know that one of them is a truth-teller, and the other is a liar, but you don't know who is who. You can ask only one question to determine who is the truth-teller and who is the liar. What question should you ask?

Solution:
To determine who is the truth-teller and who is the liar, you can ask either Alex or Bob the following question: "If I were to ask the other person which door leads to safety, what would they say?" Assume there are two doorsâ€”one leading to safety and the other to danger.

If you ask the question to the truth-teller, they will honestly tell you what the liar would say. Since the liar always lies, the truth-teller will point to the door leading to danger.

If you ask the question to the liar, they would lie about what the truth-teller would say. Since the truth-teller always tells the truth, the liar will also point to the door leading to danger.

In both cases, the answer you receive will point to the door leading to danger. Therefore, regardless of who you ask, you can determine the door leading to safety based on the answer.
